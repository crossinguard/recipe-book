## Documentation

> It is imperative that the jar you use be just slightly larger than the head of the immersion blender, and the egg/lemon mixture must be in contact with the blades of the blender before you switch it on for this to work. 
> The head of the blender must be firmly planted against the bottom of the jar until the mayonnaise starts to come together. 
> If you can't find a jar the right size, double the recipe in order to increase the starting volume of the egg/lemon mixture.
> 
> If your mayonnaise is watery, that means it has not emulsified properly. Let the mixture settle and separate, then try blending again.
